# Simple JavaScript API Fetch Project

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript's `axios` function to interact with a web API and retrieve data. The example provided shows a basic implementation of fetching data from an API endpoint and displaying it on a web page.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- A web browser capable of running JavaScript.
- An internet connection to access the API endpoint.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/parteekdcrust/cryptoTracker.git
```

2. Open the project directory in your code editor of choice.

3. In the project directory, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will load the webpage and execute the JavaScript code.

## Usage

The `app.js` file contains the main JavaScript code for fetching data from the API. The code uses the `axios` function to send a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieve the data.

To use this project with a different API, follow these steps:

1. Open the `app.js` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the `fetchData` function. Inside this function, update the `url` variable with the desired API endpoint.

```javascript
const url = '`https://api.coinstats.app/public/v1/coins/${ctype}?currency=USD`';
```

3. Customize the code as needed to parse and display the data received from the API. The example code provided in `app.js` demonstrates how to append the data to an HTML element with the ID `data-container`. Modify this code to match your desired behavior.

```javascript
const dataContainer = document.getElementById('data-container');
dataContainer.innerHTML = data;
```

4. Save the changes to `app.js`.

5. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the updated data from the new API.
